# Sonar-Robot
A robotic system equipped with ultrasonic sensors for obstacle detection and avoidance. Uses sound waves to navigate and safely maneuver through environments.

DETAILS:
The "Obstacle Avoidance Robot with Ultrasonic Sensor" is a sophisticated robotic system designed to navigate its surroundings autonomously while avoiding obstacles. It utilizes ultrasonic sensors to detect objects in its path. These sensors emit high-frequency sound waves and measure the time it takes for the waves to bounce back, allowing the robot to calculate the distance to nearby objects. By continuously scanning its environment and analyzing the sensor data, the robot can intelligently steer itself away from obstacles, ensuring smooth and safe navigation. This technology finds applications in various fields such as robotics, autonomous vehicles, and industrial automation, where precise obstacle avoidance is crucial for efficient operation.
